This script is hihgly effective combined with http://capture2text.sourceforge.net/ to quickly 'google search' any text from places you can't highlight (text from image #ocr)

Keybinds:
Cap2Text captures area with Win+Q by default.
You can create a shortcut (must be placed to Desktop) for the gsc.py script and bind it to ctrl+alt+R for example. (Note: avoid any keys that interact with AltGr - because it will overwrite functionality; for example "ctrl+alt+w" = "AltGr+W" which means that you will no longer be able to type pipe "|" with AltGr+W )
